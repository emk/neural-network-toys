# Neural network toys (personal experiments)

This was heavily inspired by [Understanding Neural Network Batch Training: A
Tutorial][tutorial], and a surprising amount of the actual code was written by
Copilot. The [iris.csv](./iris.csv) file is from the classic [Iris Data
Set][iris], by way of the article.

The gradient descent and backpropagation code has been preety carefully tested,
and any remaining errors are likely errors in my own understanding.

I should consider upgrading this to do some or all of the following:

1. Recongnize the NIST digits.
2. Use drop-outs to prevent overfitting.
3. Implement actual batch learning, just for fun.

Someday.
